Fyyur
-----

## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Your job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.



## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
Our tech stack will include the following:
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations


## Main Files: Project Structure

  ```sh
  ├── README.md
  ├── app.py *** the main driver of the app. Includes your SQLAlchemy models.
                    "python app.py" to run after installing dependences
  ├── config.py *** Database URLs, CSRF generation, etc
  ├── error.log
  ├── forms.py *** Your forms
  ├── requirements.txt *** The dependencies we need to install with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
  ├── static
  │   ├── css 
  │   ├── font
  │   ├── ico
  │   ├── img
  │   └── js
  └── templates
      ├── errors
      ├── forms
      ├── layouts
      └── pages
  ```

Overall:
* Models are located in the `MODELS` section of `app.py`.
* Controllers are also located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`


Highlight folders:
* `templates/pages` -- (Already complete.) Defines the pages that are rendered to the site. These templates render views based on data passed into the template’s view, in the controllers defined in `app.py`. These pages successfully represent the data to the user, and are already defined for you.
* `templates/layouts` -- (Already complete.) Defines the layout that a page can be contained in to define footer and header code for a given page.
* `templates/forms` -- (Already complete.) Defines the forms used to create new artists, shows, and venues.
* `app.py` -- (Missing functionality.) Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handle data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.
* Models in `app.py` -- (Missing functionality.) Defines the data models that set up the database tables.
* `config.py` -- (Missing functionality.) Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.
